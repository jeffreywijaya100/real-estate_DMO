# real-estate_DMO
1.Building a machine learning pipeline using pyspark (classification or regression tasks)

2.The data used for the project must be a public dataset.

3.Perform the following tasks:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (summarization + data visualization)

- Feature Transformation (VectorAssembler, OneCodeEncoder, PCA, or other transformation techniques)

- Machine Learning Model (Linear Regression or Logistic Regression, etc.)

- Model Validation + Evaluation

Evaluate your model using at least two metrics. For example, for regression, the metrics could be R2 and RMSE; for classification, the metrics can be accuracy and precision.

You can choose any model validation (split train/test, cross validation, etc.)
